There are just way too many social networking sites out there to keep up and that's where lifestreaming services come in. Lifestream is a time ordered stream of activities, that functions as a diary of your electronic "social" life. In this Web 2.0 era, you get to use Twitter, Facebook, Delicious, Flickr, write blog posts, keep your friends up to date, and you are curious about what your friends are up to, too. There are many social websites that will help you to aggregate all of your social activities into one place. FriendFeed is such and one of the most popular services that does the lifestreaming for you. Those sites are still externally hosted websites that cannot replace your blog or current website, even though they may offer cooler features than your blog or site.

MyStream is a fully customizable, themable, easy to configure, an open source Portal framework built on top of ASP.NET 4, that you can host on your own server. You have got the full freedom to upgrade to new more themes yet to come and maintain your existing personal branding by customizing every little piece of it. The current codebase of this pluggable architecture can stream your blogposts by RSS/Atom, Delicious bookmarks, Flickr photostream and Tweets. More to follow. You can write your own social plugin in minutes using this framework. Give your site next generation look now.
